###Artist Proof Prints
All of my prints are available as Artist Proof Prints. I personally inspect, sign and number each print ensuring museum quality work gets shipped. This is perfect for collectors that want the absolute best quality with my personal stamp of approval. I do not offer my prints in limited editions to create artificial scarcity just to command a higher price. As an artist, I create these pieces to be seen and enjoyed by everyone, not just the top tiered collectors that can afford expensive art. So if you're a collector, you still get to own something that's really scarce because I sell many more un-proofed and unsigned prints. If you're an art lover, you can also afford to own one of my prints.

###Standard Fine-art Prints
All of my photographs are available on professional quality Kodak ENDURA paper with a lustre finish. This paper is rated to display for 100 years so you can ensure these collectable prints have true archival lifespans.

		<p>Photographs are printed directly on museum quality canvas using high quality archival inks. The canvas is then stretched over a frame leaving the edges of the photo visible from the side. Choosing canvas is bold way of displaying an image having a depth of texture and a presence traditional prints cannot match.</p>
