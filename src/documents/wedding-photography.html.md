<h2>Wedding Photography <br><small>More than great images, a great experience</small></h2>
I know that a couple's wedding is one of the biggest events in their lives, and the memories saved in the photography are a major part of it. As an artist, I want to go that extra step to create beautiful images. I go beyond the traditional posed shots delivering a huge album of hand-processed images (Usually 400+). Along with all the photos, I am here for you. Not only will we have a great time, but I work to make the experience as positive as possible. That shows in both the list of services you get (see below) and how I treat you with outstanding customer service.

		<h3>I am a GOOD match for:</h3>
		<p>You should hire me if the photography is of the utmost importance to you and you want more than documention of your wedding. We shoot couples who want works of art and are willing to do their part to make it happen and plan out great photo-taking opportunities</p>
		<p>I love finding great locations to shoot at times of the day when the light is fantastic. Team that with off-camera lighting equipment and I will deliver a package  filled with crafted works of art.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>I am a BAD match for:</h3>
		<p>I am not a discount, by-the-hour kind of photographer. I'm not a good match for those that just "need a photographer" and only want basic photos of the day.</p>

### The Wedding Packages

				<h3>Get What you Want</h3>
				<p>In addition to creating prints yourself, I offer professional quality prints created from the top labs in the country. These prints will have the most vivid color and highest quality papers in the industry. From the online gallery you can pick and choose each individual pose you like and have prints shipped right to your door.</p>
				<p>In addition to normal prints, there are specialty items like canvas wraps, metal prints and coffee mugs. There are hundreds of options.</p>
				<p>This is a great way for your family to order prints for themselves. You won't have to collect print orders from everyone and deliver them. It's totally self-serve.</p>

				<h3>Have Fun with your Guests</h3>
				<p>This is a fun way for your guests to leave their mark on your special day. I setup a backdrop and lighting with a collection of fun props. The second shooter will man this during your reception. </p>

				<h3>Tell Your Story</h3>
				<p>Going beyond a simple book with your photos in it, I will design an album that tells the story of your wedding day. The book is a visual feast at 13x11 inches. Expect at least 40 pages of professional pearl paper goodness. The hardbound cover finished in linen with a dust jacket.</p> 
				<p>Seeing your images on a screen is nice. Seeing it printed and hanging on a wall is even better. Better yet is having the ability to see your album on the coffee table where you can pick it up, hold it and flip through your story.</p>
				<p>The number of pages is based on your wedding. If I can't fit all of your images into 40 pages, the book will grow to accomodate them. Ask about the cost to print additional copies for your family. Typically, additional copies are $150-200 depending on the number of pages.</p>

				<h3>Need more time?</h3>
				<p>The biggest challenge on the wedding day is shooting the formals. We are often forced to try and cram all the group shots into the 30-40 minutes between the ceremony and the reception. By shooting the formal shots of either the Bride or the Bride and Groom before your wedding, we have all the stress-free time we need.</p> 
				<p>By taking these shots early, it is also possible to offer the guests a 5x7 print on your wedding day as a gift.</p>
				<p>This is also useful for big multi-day weddings. We can even get back together after the wedding and honeymoon and do a "trash the dress" shoot.</p>
