In my mind, Groupthink is one of the most unusual social behaviors humans develop in groups. Wikipedia has a great explanation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">Groupthink</a> if you don't already know. My journey into a career as a Professional Photographer is a paradox. I don't have any formal education about how to run a business or how to take photographs. I haven't really been shooting very long, only two years. I started with digital so the learning curve wasn't as steep as film, but with the plethora of information on the internet, I traversed the curve quickly.

So what should I do to get my business off the ground? Should I find all the hot blogs and see what they're saying. Should I subscribe to a podcast that has really awesome sounding advice. How about I take a workshop and learn from someone who knows what he's doing? Perhaps I should buy the book from the guy that says he got rich using the same techniques from the book and is now getting rich off the book about how to get rich.

Here is where I stand. I've been studying this subject from many of the sources I listed above and I have noticed patterns leading to a general consensus for how things are to be done. There are certain tracks you can take to become various kinds of photographers. They are almost pre-written formulas like a treasure map leading you right to the buried gold. I think for any business to succeed, they need to sell a product that is uniquely different from the rest. It needs to be the best and it needs to stand out from the crowd of competitors.

Now lets compare running a business to simply creating great photographs. Go ask 100 photographers if they strive to be unique and stand out from the crowd and you will find a vast majority work towards this end. Ok, throw into the mix social media and blogs where the majority of photographers share their work. They can have a million different motivations for sharing, but everyone of them prefers to hear praise and constructive criticism over the mean spirited, unwanted and hurtful feedback. It's a barometer that lets us know if we're are on track.

We seek the approval of our peers and this has a HUGE impact on the photography we produce and share on the internet. If we want more likes and re-tweets, we'll start producing work that the majority people deem as a good photograph. Hopefully you're starting to see how this directly contradicts our initial goal of producing unique art that has great impact. Now please don't done get me wrong. There is a place and a time to have mentors and "rules" to go by that can help you produce stronger photographs when you're beginning, but there is a point when you start to figure out the balance and the mechanics of the pedals on your bike. That point when you're ready to remove those training wheels and start experimenting. You learn how to pre-visualize an image before you press the shutter and have a process that takes the picture from your mind's eye and creates a matching work of art. At some point in order to truly be unique, you need to pre-visualize images in a manner that doesn't follow the status quo. It has to reflect you because you are what you bring to the table that really is unqique. In general, you're going to find the community won't be receptive to it, initially. It will take time for you to establish your style among your peers and you have to grow thick skin and learn to roll with the criticism.

This applies to most anything, including running a photography business. I've made the pledge to share all of my decision along the way, to help encourage those of you who might be thinking of doing what I'm trying to do.  Just like the skills I've learned in creating a photograph, I'm having to create practices for running a photography business. I've started with a TON of research and case studies looking into many different careers as models. The patterns I've seen have been clear. There is probably 90% of the photographers out there running their business in what I'd consider the classic model. They tend to ignore the day we live in with the internet and this culture of sharing having a death grip on their copyrights thinking that is their life-blood. It's a common story among them about how the industry has changed and there just isn't money out there like there used to be. They resent the changes in the industry.

The other ten percent are breaking out of the mold and seeking new ways to share their work fully embracing the changes. Ultimately getting their names in front of the eyes of people who still purchase photography. So I have set myself up to be different. One thing I really fear in doing things my way is coming off as some kid who is just a rebellious punk. The majority  group of pro photographers have been doing things a certain way for years and they have ideas on what works and what doesn't. So when I come along, I'm breaking this mold and by sharing these decisions with everyone, I'm inviting criticism.

Some things I do know for sure. Like any one of my photographs, I have pre-visualized how I want my business to work. My job is to make this come to fruition. Yes I'll make mistakes, but I'm not going to give up. I'll keep iterating and trimming the fat and I'm going to enjoy every step of the way. I'm not going to succumb to Groupthink that is prevalent in the online photography community.
<h3>Yosemite Falls</h3>
Another shot from the land of a million reflections aka Yosemite. Yosemite is one of the bigger touristy attractions so I kind of avoided it, but how could I pass up a shot like this?
