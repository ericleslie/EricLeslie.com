### Mark Your Calendars
We're going to shoot up the <a href="http://ericleslie.com/images/Shasta">Mount Shasta area</a> the weekend of February 17,18 and 19. <a href="https://plus.google.com/110466688127241330787">Elizabeth Hahn</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110833099456633722038">John Getchel</a> and I have been planning this for the last couple of weeks.

I've got a big list of possible sites to see like Lake Siskiyou, Middle McCloud Falls, Pluto's Cave and Little Shasta Church. There's a good chance there will be snowy winter conditions, so much of where we go depends on the weather. It's going to be a casual weekend where everyone is invited to come. If you can only make part of it, we can exchange digits so we can get a hold of each other.

We're meeting in Dunsmuir at 2pm on Friday. Look on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=dunsmuir,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.224699,-122.276233&amp;spn=0.00648,0.010096&amp;hnear=Dunsmuir,+Siskiyou,+California&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;vpsrc=6">this map</a> of the Dunsmuir Recreation &amp; Park for the rendezvous.

Saturday morning, we're going to be meeting at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Mt+Shasta,+CA&amp;daddr=Unknown+road&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=41.684323,-122.476187&amp;sspn=0.048524,0.075274&amp;geocode=FbNWdgIdWbC1-ClBCAIl0-DNVDEHhkvIAS1qjg%3BFUQmfAId8Bez-A&amp;oq=mount+&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=h&amp;z=10">Trout Lake</a> in Montague at sunrise. There after, we can see a handfull of things during the day including Little Shasta Church, Pluto's Cave. In the afternoon we'll be at Lake Shasta shooting the Calatrava bridge and then the peak at Sunset.

Sunday morning we'll meet at Middle McCloud Falls in McCloud and disperse when we're done.

Look in Mount Shasta, CA for amenities. Expect to take some great photos, make some new friends and have a great time!
