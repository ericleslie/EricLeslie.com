In my <a title="My First Wedding: John and Mindy Copeland" href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/first-wedding-john-mindy-copeland/">previous post</a> about the wedding I shot with Crystal, I wrote about a big discovery I made. I learned that I really enjoy shooting people and the month following the wedding, I have been spending hours mulling it all over. Here are a few things I came up with and rolled out tonight.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Boys on a Fence" src="http://www.lesliephotos.com/Families/Some-Highlights/i-h8dXHFB/0/L/DSC0016-L.jpg" alt="" width="640" /></p>
I'm still a Landscape guy. Nature is still my first love and it will always be my top priority. I will continue to create fine-art photographs that will be available to license and get printed. I <em>wanted</em> to teach workshops. While this might happen on occasion, I came to the realization that I want to be a photographer, not a teacher. I would much rather organize a public photowalk and hangout with all of you as equals where we can all learn from each other. So workshops are on the back burner.

Now the challenge was to carefully weave shooting weddings in with my specifically Landscape branded website. I will have many tweaks to make over the coming days to enhance my SEO for local searches. I'm going to be relying heavily on search and social media to spread the word. Here are some things I had to consider when I started making changes.

Every wedding I shoot will always have Crystal there with me as a second shooter. We each have our own personally branded websites, so we decided to keep them seperate and work together to have a cohesive product that's sold from both websites. <a href="http://rideandsee.com">Her website</a> is getting a facelift and will be finished soon. Here, I have created a couple new pages. There is a new <strong><a href="http://ericleslie.com/people">People</a></strong> menu item. That takes you to a slideshow of some images and gives a brief introduction to the services we offer. There it links to a very detailed <a href="http://ericleslie.com/about/pricing">pricing page</a> where it outlines all of our totally awesome services with clearly labelled prices.

One last bit is a new domain name that I registered to connect both RideAndSee.com with EricLeslie.com, <a href="http://lesliephotos.com">LesliePhotos.com</a>. It's powered by Smugmug so we get all the benefits that come with their service. Things like unlimited image hosting, Lightroom Integration and it handles all the print sales and fulfillment. This will have minimal branding. It's biggest purpose will be to have a place to send clients to view their images and buy prints.

Thanks for reading this far. To help get this new venture started, I'd really appreciate it if you share it on your favorite social network. Good night :)
