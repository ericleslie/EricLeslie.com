After a very early morning at Tunnel View and then making a ton of stops along the Merced River catching as many angles of Yosemite Valley as possible I needed some rest. I decided to sit under a Pine tree in Ahwahnee Meadow just sitting still. I was finally able to just be quiet and I could really take it all in. There was a cool breeze meandering through the tall grass. The birds calling and peckers pecking. The laughs of two visitors telling each other a funny story. The shadow across Half Dome sliding slowly to the right across its face exposing it's details. I nearly fell asleep there.

It was a stark contrast with the crowds found all over the valley. Here, I had this view all to myself.
