The eclipse is going to pass right over Red Bluff where I live. So If any of you are planning on coming up here to shoot, I'll be up at Lassen. They are opening up the parking lot to Bumpess Hell which is walking distance from Helen Lake. Perhaps there will be nice views of Brokeoff Moutain or Mount Diller. Helen Lake may still be completely frozen still. There will probably be a bunch of people up there so get there early to reserve your spot. The Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center will also be selling glasses that will help keep your eyes protected because it's still dangerous to stare at a partially eclipsed sun.

Here is a nice <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/17/4495942/special-eclipse-viewing-planned.html.">article in the SacBee</a> talking about some extra things the Park is hosting for the eclipse if you want to participate. If you're planning on coming up, drop me a line so we can meet up. If we don't connect first look for the guy wearing a welding mask, safety first you know!
