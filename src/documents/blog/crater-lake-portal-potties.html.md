When my boys were young, they used to call porta-potties, portal-potties because they're boys. They have wild imaginations and I guess it made it less scary to use one to think you might get beamed across space and time to some new place in another dimension. So when visiting Crater Lake the first weekend in April the snow levels were still very high. There's so much snow up there that the buildings get completely buried so they setup tunnels that lead through the snow banks. So when I went to use the men's room my mind instantly looked at this passage into the snow and envisioned I was heading into a portal-potty.

I setup this shot to really emphasize how much snow there was so I got close enough to fill the frame with the side of the snowbank with a clear view of the tunnel going straight back into the snow.
