As a father of five boys, I can totally relate to the Gleason's family of three boys. So much energy and curiosity, it's easy for them to forget they are there to have their pictures taken. We met up at William Ide Adobe in Red Bluff at the peak of the fall color which made for a wonderful setting full of vivid colors. With all this sun we've been getting, the green grass is going to start pushing up and it will be green again here in Red Bluff so now is a great time to shoot your family. Give me a call, 530-727-8020.
