For whatever reason, when we come to this point where we start a new year, we reflect on the year prior and then create plans and set goals for the next one. 2011 has been one heck of a ride for me. I have brought my photography up to a level of proficiency that I've very proud of. I've been able to attach that quality to my name and establish some branding. That said, I'm still a full-time web developer.

So for 2012? I am going to go pro. By pro I mean that it will be my sole profession where my income is generated from my photography.Two months ago I launched this brand new website. This month I've been refining it and getting ready for it to go big. I'm finally getting my images posted. They are searchable. This is very important and makes it super easy to find the images you're looking for. Once found, you can easily download the original hi-res file and buy a print. I've added maps to the images that are geo-tagged which is great for those that are planning trips and want detailed information about where a shot was taken.

Soon to come will be the ability to buy additional licensing if you want to use my images commercially. I'm going to make it easy to grab links to the images so you can easily embed them into your blog posts or share on Facebook. I am going to get back on a regular blogging schedule again. I haven't been active since I rolled out the new website because I've been preoccupied with web development.

Also in the works are lots of photo walks. Did I mention they'll be free? Originally I wanted to start teaching private workshops and that might still happen, but really I just love going out shooting with people. Meeting new faces and building relationships can be just as profitable in the long run. Word-of-mouth marketing always has the highest returns. So in case you hadn't heard. I'm hosting a waterfall photowalk in Redding, CA on new years eve. 12/31. We're meeting at the Crystal Creek parking area in Whiskeytown at 7:30am. We'll spend the first half of the day there shooting the waterfalls there. Then we'll break for lunch together and meetup again at the Clear Creek Gorge to catch sunset. Be sure to let me know if you're coming.
