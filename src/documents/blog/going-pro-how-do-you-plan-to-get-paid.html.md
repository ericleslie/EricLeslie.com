The number one question I've had throughout my announcement to go Pro is, "What's your plan Eric?" That's a very good question and I plan to do my best to layout how I am going to build my photography business from the ground up. Some background first. I picked up photography at the beginning of 2010 and started a blog where I posted sporadically. My pictures started looking nice so I thought I should try to sell them. So I bought a SmugMug Pro account, threw up my images and expected the cash to just roll in. &lt;crickets&gt; A whole year went by and I didn't sell a single print. Nada. Luckily I got over it because that inspired me to create a brand new website.

See I'm a web developer who was running  a WordPress/Smugmug website with some lame free theme on top of it. It was all about getting something up because I didn't want to take the time to build it. And frankly if I started out the gate with a custom website, I wouldn't have had this prior failure to learn from in building it. First of all, I'm NOT a good web designer. I can code like a mad man, but page layout and typography are not my gift. So I outsourced it and that was the single best decision for me. I got a killer design, beautiful typography and the CSS was all built and ready to go. I built my website on top of the phenomenal PHP framework [Kohana](http://www.kohanaframework.org). I still use WordPress for the blog itself, but the rest of the website is on Kohana and it flows seamlessly between each half. The biggest reason to build it on a framework instead of a CMS/Blog was the flexibility to build whatever I wanted. I didn't have to work within the limitations of WordPress. Secondly I wanted speed. WordPress when loaded with a few plugins is stupid slow.

### Building an Awesome SEO optimized Website
There are a million websites from a million different photographers with images listed in galleries all in the same format. I wanted something different. I want **big** and beautiful thumbnails and beg you to click and see them full size. So I went with a Flickr style stream where the default view lists the images in the order they were uploaded and the thumbnails are nearly 450px wide. Pretty handy for those that want to check back and see what's new on a regular basis. There are several ways to narrow down what you're looking for as well. First you can search. Next, if you're looking at an image you love and want to see more like it, you can click on one of the tags listed to see a page full of other similar images. And lastly, you can simply browse by location and subject. This covers my visitors pretty nicely. It offers a lot of discover-ability to keep visitors moving around through my website easily finding lots of great content.

I'm getting ahead of myself though. People usually will find your website through a search, most often a Google search. So I took SEO (search engine optimization) very seriously. I have always shied away from SEO because I had wrongly associated all SEO with black-hat types of techniques where you might pad your page with bogus keywords or pay for backlinks. However it's a legitimate problem, especially for a photograph. Google's web crawler, Googlebot, can only see your site's HTML and it can see when there is an image on the page, but they have no way of knowing what that images is picture of. So I have taken the time to keyword tag and caption **every** single image. My website uploader automatically pulls the EXIF data out of the file and displays the camera settings with each image. If the photo is geo-tagged, a map is shown so people can see where it was taken. I have also written stories and added additional information for many of the photos. This is all necessary for Google to show your images when people search.

The hard part about SEO is getting it all setup. Now that it's there, it's a waiting game. I need Google to crawl my site, index it and then I need back-links to get my pages to rank well in the search results. This is going to happen, it just takes time. How am I going to build back-links? I don't have to do anything actually. The secret is how I license my images with Creative Commons. I use Creative Common non-commercial which means anyone is free to take my high resolution images and use them however they want on their personal blog or computer wallpaper. The only thing I want in return is a link back to EricLeslie.com. So someone who's blogging about volcanic activity might want to use of my images of Lassen in their post. They can use the image free of charge and I get extra Google juice to boost my search results and everyone is happy.

### Travel More
This leads me into the second part of my plan, travel. When I first started getting into photography I thought the only way to really stand out as a photographer was to do original work. So I avoided the big tourist stops like the plague. What I didn't realize was, the famous locations are the ones people visually recognize and search for. They may not know the most famous photograph of Tunnel View in Yosemite, but if your shot is the first they see, they are more likely to buy it from you. In the last two years, I have done little to no travelling. I'm not wealthy and I have big family so its expensive to gas the suburban and sleep in hotels. I live in a very central location to some of the most beautiful places on earth here in Northern California so I'm going to venture out and start to bag some of these shots I've never taken. This means going out at least twice a month on weekends often alone without my family. I'll be sleeping in my car, eating ramen noodles and oatmeal to keep my expenses low.

On some of these trips I'm going to organize some photo walks just to have some fun and network with other people around the country. I've already started doing this and it's great getting to build lasting relationships with people offline that you met online. I also think this helps tremendously with name recognition. How many photographers make it over into the mainstream as household names like movie actors? That's not my goal to be famous per se, but if someone is learning how to take their first pictures and say they want to learn more by taking a workshop, they are going to look up the photographer they're most familiar with first. That leads me into the last part of my plan.

### Teach Others Via Workshops
I want to teach photography workshops. Through social networking, I have built substantial followings and I want to harness that to help get the word out. I think this will offer me the biggest opportunities to earn some income in the short term because everything I've outlined above is a very long term strategy. So I need to choose some locations, schedule them on the calendar, build my curriculum and fill all the seats. I'm going to start light with small classes over shorter time periods. I want to cover the big subjects like composition, light and how it affects your subject, camera settings and how to process the images in Lightroom.

Those are the highlights and only time will tell if I can make it by June when I'd like to quite my day job as a Web Developer. It's important to note that while I have set for myself an aggressive timeline, I will not consider it a failure if I need two more months. This is going to happen. I'll be keeping you updated on my progress and I'll let you know what works and what doesn't. The key is to learn from those mistakes (like my first website), forgive myself, correct the problem and keep moving forward.

### Today's Daily Photo
Potem Falls is a big waterfall that's kind off the radar near Redding, CA. You drive all over the place making turns down roads that aren't marked and stop on spot on the road that isn't labeled. Just be sure to keep your windows rolled down so you can listen for falling water. That's my kind of landscape.
