For me the subject of tripods is a less than glamorous one. It's just not one of those really "cool" pieces of gear like that 70-200 f/2.8 lens you've been drooling over. I'm here to tell you though, tripods are sexy. If you shoot landscapes or macros, a tripod is going to be a huge factor in the quality of your work. My first tripod was a lightweight model that was easy to pack along on hikes, but it wasn't very stable and struggled to support the weight of my DSLR.

In search of a replacement, I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I also didn't want to have to upgrade again later that year because it failed or it didn't meet my needs. I wanted an affordable, lightweight and extremely stable tripod. I found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=induro%20akb&amp;tag=ericlesliecom-20&amp;index=aps&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Induro AKB series kits</a>. I picked up the <a href="http://amzn.to/rvudDe">Induro AKB2</a> which is the tallest model they sell. It has a max height of 65.9 inches. I'm 6' 1" and is just about eye level. No more hunching over when I want an eye level shot. Since it's tall, the folded length is a long 28.7 inches. For me the extra effort of packing it is worth all the flexibility in the field. It comes with a strap which I use to sling it over my shoulder and I don't really know its there.

It being so tall, you'd think it weighs ten pounds. However, the tree is constructed from magnesium and the legs are aluminum which keeps the weight down to 4.2 lbs. Higher end tripods with carbon fiber and CNC machined ball heads can get down into the 3lb range but you're going to pay double or triple. I think the extra pound is worth the cost savings. If money is no object for you, go for the best. The rest of us will love the AKB2's balance of cost and weight.

<h2>What can it do?</h2>
First and foremost, this tripod is rock solid. I've shot in high 60mph winds. I've stood it on the end of an icy slope. I've been thigh deep in a fast moving creek and my shots all come out sharp. It's very easy to use with big and easy to set controls. Starting at the ground, there are three leg sections which are a snap to setup. There are only two clamps per leg so it's very easy to go from folded to full height quickly.

If you're setting up on uneven terrain, which always seems to be the case for me, there is a bubble level in the tree to ensure your tripod is where it should be. I often extend the tripod to it's full height, leave the top two leg clamps open and then use the weight of the camera to set it to the height I want using the level as my guide. When I'm there, I lock it down and I can count on it.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6112.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-818  aligncenter" title="Magnesium keeps it rigid and light" src="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6112-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="283" /></a></p>
If you're on really uneven terrain or you need to get really low to the ground, the leg locks have three positions. If I need to get really low, I will move two legs to their highest setting and lay it over. It's amazing how sturdy it remains, even when bent over in such an embarrassing position.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6118.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-822  aligncenter" title="Getting Low" src="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6118-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6119.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-823  aligncenter" title="Unusual conditions" src="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6119-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="283" /></a></p>
If you need some extra height, the center column lock is large and easy to open and close. You don't have to really tighten it down to ensure your gear won't move.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6109.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-843 aligncenter" title="Ball head and vertical column controls." src="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6109-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="283" /></a></p>
Next up is the head. Out of personal preference, I like to use ball-heads because their controls are simple and fast. In this case, there is a <em>single </em>clamp. You just move it where you want it, twist the lock and it's there. It can be vertical, horizontal or any combination in between and it will hold your camera there. The mounting plate also has it's own bubble level which only really helps you out when you're shooting horizontally. It's a nice touch.

If you ever shoot in the cold you will also really appreciate the foam grip on this one leg. I've read others say how nice this is, but I didn't fully appreciate it until I was in frigid conditions and accidentally grabbed a bare leg. Just trust me, it's a nice comfort feature.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6113.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-819 aligncenter" title="Foam Grip" src="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MG_6113-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="425" /></a></p>
Some other things that I don't use much, but are important to note, you can reverse the center column if you need to literally set your camera on the ground for a long exposure. There is a spring loaded hook to hang your pack on for extra ballast in those really windy conditions. I've used this a few times. It took 60mph gusts to really test it. For storage, it has a really high quality padded case. I'm always out shooting so I rarely put in there for storage, but it's nice when I need it.
<h2>What I wish it could do</h2>
With anything, there is always a compromise. Since this is what I'd call a budget tripod, under $200. You have trade offs. The legs don't always slide smoothly. Especially if they get wet. I'm always standing in the middle of creeks, so this happens often for me. This is a ball head and you can move it into any position, but sometimes it can be tricky. See there is a channel in it that allows movement in one axis. If you want to move in the opposing axis, you have to twist the ball head. This means the position of the clamp has to move to a less than convenient position and on occasion you have to play with it to dial it in. Higher end tripods will allow you to move the camera in two axis without rotating the ball head.

The other major thing this head lacks is a separate control for panning. If you like to do stitched panoramas, this isn't the most ideal head. To do a pano with this head, you have to totally unlock your camera, carefully pan it hoping you didn't move too much up or down and lock it back into place. With a separate control for panning you can lock in the position vertically and still pan left and right. I don't shoot many panos, so I can deal with this.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
As you can see in these example photos, this is my real tripod that I use everyday. There are scratches and blemishes to prove it. When we're talking about compromise, usually you have to balance features with cost. You can't have everything for nothing. Since this is an affordable tripod they had to compromise a little bit. I believe they did it in all the right places. The tripod is still very easy to use and most of all, it's parts are the highest quality ensuring a rock solid platform for your camera. Induro is an American company. Their higher end models are made in the USA as well. The AKB line is not unfortunately. Induro also stands behind their equipment offering a 5 year warranty on parts. No one else can touch that! I highly recommend this tripod.
