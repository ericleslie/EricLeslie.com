Let's talk about this idea of selling photographic prints in limited editions. So let me first give the nutshell explanation for what a Limited Edition actually is. An artist will choose to make a photograph available for print and they will set a limit on the total number of prints they will produce. Once that number is reached, they legally cannot sell another. Opposed are Open Editions where there are no limits, so the artist will produce as many prints as there is demand for.

<strong>Why Limit Them?
</strong>The arguments in favor of limiting are clear. Scarcity boosts value, many galleries require it and collectors won't buy without it. All true, yet you need to take a step back and ask yourself why two identical prints can have separate values simply based on a marketing ploy that has nothing to do with the quality or creativity of the piece.

In the days of film when glass negatives could only be developed a set number of times before the quality started to degrade, limited editions where the natural bi-product of the technology of the day. If a photographer could only produce 50 prints, that's all there would ever by. Today, a new print is a click away.

<strong>Is Manufactured Scarcity the Same as Real Scarcity?
</strong>Many famous photographers like Thomas Kinkade and Ansel Adams never limited their editions. Their original signed work is highly collectible and valuable. They don't command high prices because they set artificial limits on their editions to boost scarcity, they truly are rare. You can still buy newly produced prints created for Adams' original negatives at a fraction of the cost of those created by Adams himself. Since Ansel has passed away, there is a finite number of prints and there is real scarcity.

In other industries where supply is artificially suppressed, those companies get accused of price gouging and get investigated. If OPEC decides to cut production because they want the price to go up, we all get upset. Are we then to take these tactics and use them in our own business practices because that's what "everyone in the industry does". Ethically, I have a hard time turning these tactics around on people when my intent is for my photography to have a positive impact on them.

<strong>The Arbitrary Nature of the Editions</strong>
To expand on what an edition is and how arbitrary they really are, lets talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eggleston">Willing Eggleston</a>. He recently auctioned off brand new prints from a collection that was previously sold as a limited edition. The only difference now being the new prints are much larger using a different printing technology. A collector who owned pieces from the original edition is actually suing Eggleston claiming these new prints devalue his collection.

The problem lies in how arbitrarily you can specify your editions. You can say you're going to limit prints of a certain size, a certain print media or go as far as to say the image has been remastered and that you have a completely new photograph. There are no standards and as such, the Eggleston collector may not have a case based on how the original limited edition was specified.

What's in the number anyway? It seems so many artists are setting limits like 500 and none of their editions are close to selling out. They might as well have just said they are limiting the edition to the number the market is willing to bear. If they're going to set a limit, why not set a real limit like 25 or just a single print?

Did you know that in California, if a limited edition has been sold out, that you are required to destroy the negative or digital file? How many of you actually do that?

<strong>Who gets to enjoy your work?
</strong>Much of the reason I share my work on the internet is much in the same way when one of my sons draw a picture and wants me to see it. It's not an issue of ego, we just want other people to experience what we just created. So I think it's perfectly normal to crave this same kind of attention because it feeds our will to create knowing we can impact someone's life with our art. In the same manner I want to have my works accessible to everyone to consume digitally and physically as a print.

Why should those collectors with deep pockets be the only ones who get to enrich their lives with art. Art should be accessible to everyone who can benefit from it. As with any career path you choose, ethics and morality should always be front and center. Our art and our reputation is all a product of how we conduct ourselves. How then can I ethically limit my editions if I want it to be accessible and free from market manipulation? I can't.

<strong>So what do you do?
</strong>This is largely an uphill battle and its our jobs to educate collectors about the different between artificial and real scarcity. Seek out galleries that will represent you regardless of how you edition the prints.

On my website, I offer two kinds of prints and they're both open editions without limits. I offer unsigned and unproofed prints that go straight from my lab to your doorstep. These are the most affordable and allow most anyone to own my art with prints starting at $20.  I also offer the same prints as an Artist Proof. These prints are hand-proofed by yours truly, so I guarantee they are perfect and look exactly as I intended them to look. They are signed and numbered. These cost more because there is more labor involved and they really are rare because fewer of these are sold. I number them because they indicate age so history can look back and see how I've changed with time. Ansel's interpretation of "Moonrise over Hernandez" changed over the years and the older prints are much different than the newer ones. Traditionally collectors value older works from an artist more highly, so numbering with the date are important.

I just want to encourage you that you can make money taking the high road. While it's easier to sell one expensive print than many cheaper ones, think of how many more people who's lives will be touched with your artwork. The goodwill will spread through word of mouth and you will sleep well at night.
