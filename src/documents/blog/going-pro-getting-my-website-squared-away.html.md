I can't stress enough how important a great website is for your photography business. How is any potential client going to take you seriously if your images are great but the website looks like a Geocities template? I know many photographers are just that, photographers and they might not have any experience in web design. I highly recommend you either spend the time to school yourself up or bite the bullet and outsource it. You can thank me later. Read [Casey Mac's blog post](http://www.caseymacphoto.com/tips-for-building-a-perfect-photo-portfolio-web-site) outlining some great tips to step up your website's game.

Today I had a big chunk of time to bring my site across the finish line. I'm hesitant to say that because your website is never really finished, but you have to define goals. Today I finished several big ones.

* The **shopping cart** box was stuck to the top right corner of the website and it was blocking the social buttons. Lets not forget it was plain ugly. I figured out how to attach it to some other element, so I created a navigation bar link. It looks WAY better.
* My images are shown in a very Flickr-like stream where they are in order by date uploaded. I implemented search last month, but unless you know all the details about my work, you wouldn't really know what I've shot so you wouldn't find much searching. So I built a page that outlines some "smart galleries". They are broken down by location and subject. That will make user navigation to the images many times better.
* A **Links button** was added to the photo detail page. I want to encourage people use my images on their websites when it's non-commercial in nature. One of the caveats of using them for free is they must link back to me. So not only are they advertising for me, I'm getting high quality back links. Big SEO benefits. The links popup offers different sized images with an HTML snippet so they can drop the code in a blog post and be done.
* There has been a button to order prints from the beginning of the redesign, but I just added a button so people can <strong>license</strong> my images right from my site. It opens a lightbox with all the details about how to license and image with a form to collect all the vital information. When they submit the form, it emails me all the details. This is important because I expect to drive more income from licensing than from print sales.
* There are a slew of small visual changes and tweaks that area all too small to mention on their own.
* I finished moving my whole image portfolio online so you can find all of my best work now.

### With all that out of the way, what's next?
I want to ditch how the images are paginated. I only show 8 images per page and after that, they are broken up into pages. It's too many clicks! I want to change that to "infinite scroll" so the images still load 8 at a time, but when you scroll to the bottom of the page, 8 more will load below. So on and so forth until you've seen all the images. I also want to build a gallery that shows the most popular images based on image views. I'm already collecting these statistics, so it will pretty easy to build.

Last but not least, I want to organize my photowalk and workshop schedule and build that section of the website. I may just include a public Google Calendar so you can easily see what's up. We'll see what actually happens.  I hope this information was helpful for you. I take much of it for granted, so if you have any questions, let me know.

Spring hits the high country late, so the snow was still melting when I shot Reading peak at sunrise. It still wasn't dry enough for the wildflowers to have come in, but it was a beautiful morning. The road into Hat Creek wasn't open yet, but the road was plowed, so it was a simple 1/4 mile walk down from the parking area.
