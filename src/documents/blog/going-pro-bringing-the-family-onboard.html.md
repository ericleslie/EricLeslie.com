The talk of going pro has always been in the air from my earliest moments as an amateur photographer. It's been batted back and forth in lofty dream kinds of tones. So when it came down to the decision to actually make it happen, it was met with a cold sense of reality that had to be taken seriously for the first time.

See, I'm going to be walking away from a comfortable and steady job as a web developer and stepping into uncertainty and discomfort. So when I sat down with my wife to talk about this, it turned into an emotional moment. Once the reality set in, all sorts of concerns came up that were never taken seriously in the dreaming stage. Having a savings set aside for the the downswings will be essential. Concern for my physical safety. Often times I'm going to be hiking in the wilderness alone in the dark and no cell reception. Traveling means there will be big chunks of time when I am completely away from my family.

Once we came to grips with these realities, everything started to make sense again so we could open a calendar and make some plans. One of the biggest adjustments will being separation. Up to this point we almost always go out shooting together and in order to get out to some big new locations, I'm just going to have to go out alone. We can't afford to take the Suburban with a load of kids and drag them all over hell and high water at O'Dark Thirty. It's not really much fun for kids at the frequency I need to shoot. I've got a cheap commuter car that I will be spending many a night sleeping in because I can't afford to stay in a motel every night. That way I'm just paying for some gas and food that I'm already eating. Who said photography was glamorous?

My latest shot is from the New Years Photowalk that I hosted at [Whiskeytown](http://ericleslie.com/images/whiskeytown). There are two main waterfalls on [Crystal Creek](http://ericleslie.com/images/crystal+creek) that are always fun to shoot, but if you're willing to hike both up and down stream, there are little gems like this waiting to have their pictures taken. What I'm drawn to in this image is the lizard-head shaped rock on the right hand side that looks like it has a marble in it's mouth. As far as I can tell it's completely natural, but I can't explain it. It looks like someone split the rock clean in half and then took a near perfectly spherical rock and put it in between. Very cool!
