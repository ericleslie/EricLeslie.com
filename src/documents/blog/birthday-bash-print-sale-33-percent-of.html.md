I haven't really said anything about this promotion yet, but I'm going to let you in on it first for being one of my loyal readers. As a big thanks to all of you that have been reading my blog and admires of my photography giving me so much support, I am going to give something back to you. In lieu of this being my 33 trip around the Sun, I'm offering a 33% off coupon code available on all of my prints. That adds up to some serious savings on the the metal and canvas prints. That also means the 8x10s start at $12.50 plus shipping!

Just use the coupon code **"happybirthday"** during checkout. The offer lasts through the end of June.
<h3>The Mighty Sacramento River in Red Bluff</h3>

This is one of the hidden secrets here in Red Bluff. You get this perfect view above the rolling hills that are peppered with age-old Oak trees. I've been out here many times to shoot this view, but never have I been greeted with a good sunset like this one. Finally!

How often are you willing to go back to the same place to get that perfect light?
