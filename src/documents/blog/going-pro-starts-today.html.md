I'm not sure what you really know about me, but I'm a web developer that takes pictures. It's been that way for the last two years when I picked up my first camera. The time has come to reverse those roles. I'm going pro.

Just like that? Yes! I have an aggressive goal of quitting my day job by June. All of my dreams are making this unusual metamorphosis into plans. It's time to get serious and put some things on the calendar.

So what Eric? Well, what photographer hasn't had the dream of being a full time landscape photographer that gets to travel the world and live at sunrise and sunset? How many fewer actually get to give it a try? I'm going to take you along on my journey. You can both live vicariously through me and you can learn from my mistakes. In my experience interacting with other photographers, there always seems to be this odd void separating the people that are already pros and those that are not and some that want to be. How do you cross the abyss? It starts with a decision (check) and it's followed by some calculated risks that I'm setting up for. I'm going to be working really hard, I'm going to be away from my family more than I want to be and I'm going to be sleeping in my car to keep travel cheap.
