Did you know that you don't have to get family portraits taken in a studio? That may seem rhetorical, but many of the families I shoot tell me that they've always done the department store portraits never really considering anything else. Perhaps thinking it's too expensive, but often they never think about it. It doesn't have to be expensive and the photos and experience will be so much better!

This shoot with the Gleasons at Dog Island Park (Ayer Park) in Red Bluff was a fun shoot during the peak of the fall colors. This is a great time of the year to <a href="http://ericleslie.com/portrait-photography">book senior portraits</a> too.
