I don't know about you, but when I shoot something I take it as my personal responsibility to make my subject look as amazing as possible. There are innumerable ways to do this, but if you're shooting a woman and want to give her something special, consider pouring tons of light on her.

Lets first talk about why all of this light works and then I'll dissect this shot to let you know just how easy it can be. When using lighting there is this idea of ratios between the lighted side of the subject and the unlighted shadow side of the subject. I bigger ratio will have darker shadows and is usually better suited for men. It has an edgy-gritty feel to it so if the person has rough skin it will show much more texture. Usually woman want to have smooth and blemish free skin, so have a low ratio is preferable. In this case there is very little shadow on her face and her skin look soft and smooth.

In the real world, not every woman you shoot will be a super model and they may be overweight. Not only does this technique help smooth out skin, it also minimizes imperfections in her figure. It's really hard to see a double chin or a love handle when there isn't a shadow in the crease that makes it look like the Grand Canyon.

<h3>Light Setup</h3>
Before I explain how simple this setup really was, I just want to encourage you go beyond reading these steps as a kind of recipe to create a certain shot. I've always found my best results come by experimentation. Every situation is different and if you're with a client, you'll need to know how to adapt to the conditions where you can make good choices quickly to get the great results they hired you for.

Let me fill you in on a big secret with this shot. This was not some fancy studio production with a stylist and the whole 9 yards. In fact, my wife was just sitting at her desk at the end of a long day. No make-up and pajamas were in full effect! She wasn't feeling beautiful and was kind of annoyed I was pointing my camera in her face. I was doing some test shots with the very affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GZLFHM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004GZLFHM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ericlesliecom-20">Yongnuo YN-560 speedlight</a> (Look for a review on that).

Her desk is basically in a corner so there was a white wall behind her and in front of her. She was about three feet from the corner. I had the speedlight mounted on the hot-shoe aimed towards the right. The flash was set to it's widest focal length and I bounced it off the wall to the right. I took a test shot was pleasantly surprised how it was so evenly illuminating her. It wasn't bright enough, so I pushed up the power of the speedlight three stops letting the histogram really push up hard against the highlights.

On my D90 and the 50mm f/1.8D, I started shooting at f/3.5 which has a really nice depth of field getting her whole head in focus. However I started experimenting by opening up the aperture all the way to 1.8. F/1.8 only holds half of her face in focus, but it had a wonderful side effect. It really softened her cheek line behind her nose so it seamlessly blends into the completely white background.

I don't really need to go into post processing here. I set a custom white balance so I could get this bright really white skin tone. Using a Curves adjustment, I pushed the highlights even more so I the the background would go completely white. I didn't want to see the drywall texture. That's it!

So looking at this diagram, I show how I'm reflecting a single strobe off the backdrop and setting a large reflector on the other side to re-create my corner. I'm sure there are other ways you could do this with more light sources, but why complicate it? By bouncing the flash, you don't need a diffuser  and by using a corner in a room, you don't need to worry about back drops and reflectors. Don't forget to experiment. I didn't set out to achieve this look, it was more a happy accident that was the result of trying different settings.
