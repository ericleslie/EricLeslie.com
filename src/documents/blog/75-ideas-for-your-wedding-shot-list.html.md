You're engaged and you're getting married in a month. You've hired a photographer and you need to make sure you get all the shots you want. The day of your wedding is fast paced and you've got bigger things on your mind than what poses need to be made. It's best if you and your photographer have a list of shots you've agreed upon so nothing gets skipped. When I book a wedding, I like to supply this list of shots to my clients so they know exactly what they're going to get. I also encourage them to write down any additional ideas they have and add them to the list for their wedding.

I also recommend you customize this list to fit your weddings needs. Depending on your religious and cultural background, there can be many different wedding traditions that differ. For example, you don't shoot the actually ceremony for an LDS wedding. Traditional Mexican weddings have the La Vibora de la Mar celebration during the reception. The groom will break a glass in a Jewish wedding. 

So take some time to build your own shot list so you don't accidentally forget something.
