For some time now, I've been meaning to create this video giving you a proper introduction. I love seeing video from other photographers because this visual medium conveys things written communication can't quite match. My hope is that we can better get to know each other beyond what you can pickup from reading my posts and looking at my photos. For me, much of the interest I have in a photograph comes from the photographer who creates it. The better I know the photographer, the stronger the connection I have to their work.

I would love to hear your feedback on this. My hope is to do more videos in the future where I can give short little nugget sized tips. Would you watch them?
