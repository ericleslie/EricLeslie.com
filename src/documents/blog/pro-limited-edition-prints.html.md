<strong>Updated:</strong> I no longer offer my prints as limited editions and I went into great detail explaining the <a title="Are Limited Edition Prints Ethical?" href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/are-limited-edition-prints-ethical/">ethics of limited edition prints</a>.

Lets talk about how I structured my print editions. When I first made prints available, they were offered in open editions which meant there were no limits on the number of prints I'd offer for sale. I thought I was taking the moral highroad with this model because I believed limited editions were artificially creating scarcity and a pseudo collectible item. This day and age, we don't (usually) develop our prints from glass negatives which have physical limits on the number of prints you can make.

Yet considering input from my friends and other established photographers like Trey Ratclif, who all suggested offering prints in limited editions, I changed my position. The bottom line is art collectors want to know they have a unique and rare piece of artwork or they won't buy. They don't want to go into Walmart one day and see the same shot on a poster on sale for ten bucks. They buy artwork as an investment and expect it to appreciate with time. This is only possible through scarcity, no matter how it's created.

So I am re-introducing <a href="http://ericleslie.com/about/prints">my prints</a> in three different limited editions. At the top of the collect-ability curve, each photograph will be offered in a Single Edition Metal Print. That's right, I will only sell one. So you will be the proud owner one a one-of-a-kind photographic print infused directly on aluminum. The colors are so vibrant and rich that it feels 3D. This is a relatively new printing process that will turn heads. I'm initially pricing these at $5995.

Next up are the Extreme Edition Canvas Wraps. They will be limited to a run of 3 wraps. They are printed using vibrant archival inks right onto museum grade canvas stretched over a wood frame. The texture of the canvas adds an element of depth and richness a traditional print cannot offer. Though not as rare as the Single Edition Metal Prints, they are still highly collectible belonging to a set of just three canvases. I am offering them for $1295.

Last up are the affordable standard Limited Edition Prints. These are traditional photographic prints created on Kodak Endura paper.  They are priced so that most everyone can afford them with prices starting at $35 for an 8x12. These will be limited to 100 prints before they are closed.

I believe the consensus in the industry, is that most photographers don't make a lot of money from prints in terms of the total size of their income pie. So with that in mind, it will be much easier to sell a single print for $6,000 than 600 prints for $100. So I want to price my work at a point where I don't have to work as hard fulling prints, and I still get to sell a product that art collectors really want. A rare and collectible fine-art print that will appreciate in value with time.

Another side to all of this is the bookkeeping I have to do to keep the editions honest. So I have integrated the counts into my gallery. I will keep track of the sales for each image and the gallery will automatically close each edition when they're sold out. It will also alert you when the edition is nearing the end to encourage people to purchase the piece they want before it closes.

 I took a drive one afternoon just heading west from Red Bluff, CA into the cattle country. The sun was getting low when we passed by this ravine that was just cut out of the country side. It made for an awesome view of the gorgeous light that arrived at sunset. It cast this amazing salmon colored light across the whole scene.
