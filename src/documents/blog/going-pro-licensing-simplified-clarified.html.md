As a photographer, my biggest goal is get my work to rise above commodity where the only way to compete is on price into a specialty product or service that can't be matched anywhere else. So I'm using both search and social media for my lead generation and I want to let my images and my personality set my work apart. I want them to believe when they see one of my images or read one of my blog posts about an adventure that it's something unique that can't be found anywhere else in the world.

Based on my research, it's typical for Professional Photographers to make equal or greater sales through commercial licensing compared to fine-art print sales. With the exception of those that sell their images from Photo Shelter, photographers expect a buyer to send them an email to start the process. Just what everyone needs is to find time to write another email. That feels too much like work. So I wanted to simplify the process and make it clear what information I need to accurately quote them. This saves the unnecessary follow up emails asking for additional information.

What I did was create a simple form that collects all of the important information and explains the whole process in detail so my customers know what to expect. For me, if a service isn't clear and easy to purchase, I'll move on and I think this holds to true for most of us.

So when you browse through my images and view the full-page of information you'll find a "License" button that pops up a form to quickly get an estimate for additional licensing. Even if this is too hard, I easily make my email **and** my phone number available if that's their preference.

I've also put together a new page that explains what [Creative Commons](http://ericleslie.com/about/licensing) is all about so anyone concerned about staying above reproach has a clear idea what they are allowed to do with my images at no cost and what requires addition licensing.

In case you didn't know, for non-commercial use, you may use my images free of charge as long as you link back to EricLeslie.com giving me credit for the photo. I'm not scared. I'm actually really excited about this. It's a back-link generation mill that will significantly boost my search rankings. For those that want to use my work commercially, I will earn some licensing fees based on a number of factors like, the prominence of use, where it's getting used, size of the audience, length of use, etc. This model does a great job of balancing my philosophy that my art should get shared with as many people as possible with the costs to produce these images. Life is good!

### Daily Photo
Landscape photography can be a great frustration or one of the greatest joys in life. The weather is the biggest factor in how this pendulum will swing and you have zero control over it. The only remedy is to be willing to change your original plans on a dime and still bag a good shot from a spur of the moment plan B. On this trip I had great hopes of shooting Mount Lassen at sunset with the Painted Dunes as my foreground. Only a huge thunderstorm rolled in  completely blocking the sunset. So I turned around 180 degrees and discovered the clouds were casting this amazing diffused light on the Cinder Cone and dunes. This isn't what I set out for, but it I came home with some very strong portfolio shots.
