<img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 15px;" title="Google Plus for Photographers Cover" src="http://ericleslie.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Google-Plus-for-Photographers-Cover-234x300.png" alt="" width="234" height="300" /></a>My life as a photographer is still in it's infancy by most standards, so when Google+ was opened up to a small beta test group via invite in 2011, I managed to secure a seat the first week and was naturally excited because I was already a Google fanboy. I didn't know that this new service was going to be a turning point in my career as photographer. I was just another nobody producing images I thought were pretty good like so many other aspiring photographers. A few people like my mom would leave comments of encouragement. Somehow Google+ leveled the playing field and I was accepted into this group of artists who were sharing their work, bouncing ideas off of one another and creating real friendships.

Pro photographer Colby Brown was another early G+ adopter. The first 3-4 months the service was beta tested there was a tsunami of innovation and new iterations by the development team that it was a bit hard to keep up with. As the population grew so did some confusion as people coming from Twitter and Facebook were trying to use those paradigms here on a totally new network based on the circles. In stepped Colby who put together the definitive guide for photographers on how to fully leverage G+. That guide eventually turned into this book.

Google+ for Photographers is more than just a guide teaching you how to use the tools and features. It covers the best practices for posting pictures, organizing people into circles, sharing content to those circles and much much more. What I think is the significant meat of this book lies in his wisdom for how to leverage G+ to build real relationships with people. There are some subtle nuances that Colby helps you master that ultimately help you grow your audience. That's what we as photographers want right? It doesn't matter if you are doing it for work or pleasure, we have this simple desire to share our creations with people. As photographers, we are edified when we can touch other people through our work. There really isn't ego involved here.
