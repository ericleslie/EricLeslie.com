So you're getting more serious about photography and you're starting to learn about the three pillars of exposure: aperture, shutter speed and ISO. You've started sharing your photos on sites like Flickr and 500px and you've noticed this acronym HDR getting thrown around. A lot! Today, I want to spend a minute explaining what HDR stands for and why you might want to use it.

Before I try to define for you what HDR stands for, you need to know the problem it's trying to solve. When we look at a landscape with our eyes, we can see details in both the darkest shadows and the brightest highlights. When we try to take our camera and shoot this same scene, you'll find the camera will do one of two things. It will correctly expose the image for the shadows leaving the brighter areas over-exposed or it will correctly expose for the brighter area leaving the shadows under-exposed and completely black.

This range between the highlights and shadows is called the dynamic range and is measured in "stops". The H in HDR stands for high dynamic range. It is a technique used in post production to expand the limited range your camera can see. The way this is traditionally done starts with a tripod. You find your composition, lock down your tripod so your camera doesn't move and you take multiple shots using different settings. Many like to turn on auto-bracketing to shoot at least three shots. The first shot is exposing for the highlights by compensating down -2 EVs (-6 stops). The second shot is the middle exposure right at 0 EVs with the third exposing for the darkest areas at +2 EVs (+6 stops).

From here there are many different software tools you can use to blend them all together into a single shot that now has detail in both the shadows and the highlights. Hands down the most popular product is <a href="http://amzn.to/KD6PxU">Photomatix 4</a>. <a href="http://amzn.to/JGLdTR">Photoshop CS6</a> (back through CS3) offers a tool called HDR Pro. Nik software also has a popular and effective tool <a href="http://amzn.to/JaIhvY">HDR Efex Pro</a>. The image below was created from just the two shots above. They were manually blended together using Layer Masks in Photoshop creating a very natural result.

You will also find that the use of HDR is somewhat controversial. There are people that love HDR and use it almost exclusively. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are those whose dislike for HDR borders on pure hatred. When you create HDR images, there are numerous techniques (too many to mention here) that can net results that are very realistic and others that are very surrealistic. In the end, photography is an expression of your vision and it doesn't really matter what people think. Photography is supposed to be fun and I always encourage people to experiment with it. Make mistakes and learn from them. Only then will you really have a good idea what you like in photography and hope to create in the future.

When you see a photo, can you tell if it was processed using HDR or not? How do you feel about the technique and it's place as an art form?
