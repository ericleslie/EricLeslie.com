It's been a busy couple of weeks. It feels like I've been shooting non-stop for the last 14 days. I shot my first wedding, I hosted a three day photowalk around Mount Shasta and I spent last weekend in Yosemite. I have a lot to tell, but I want to start with Yosemite. I've been visiting the park since I was a boy, but I haven't been since I got into photography two years ago. So this was my first trip with my new photographer eyes. It's inspirational for everyone that visits, but it was a totally new experience behind my lens.

I tried to shoot Horsetail Falls during that window where the setting sun hits just the falls creating this molten lava look. This winter has been so dry, Horsetail wasn't more than a seep, but it still looks cool with the light hitting El Capitan. I got the pleasure of meeting up with Lori Hibbert and Jeffrey Sullivan who are very familiar with the park and showed me some great spots I would not have found alone. So thanks you two!

Tonight, I'm sharing my sunset shot from the classic Tunnel View overlooking the valley. To the left you have the mighty El Capitan and on the right is Bridalveil Falls with Cathedral Rock. Further back is Half Dome. Coming into Yosemite, I wasn't sure how I'd feel about shooting in the crowds of people. Having to setup close to other photographers competing for a view of the landscapes. While it was busy like I feared, people were cordial and real pleasure to meet. People who all share the same passion I do, so there was an instant connection with these total strangers. So the competition quickly turned intoÂ comradery.
