So this is all a very interesting turn in the life of this landscape photographer. I've been shooting landscapes for the last two years completely smitten and completely monogamous. Yeah, I would shoot pictures of my kids and family, but I always had it in my head that I hated shooting people. Most of that probably stemmed from the countless shoots of grumpy kids not having enough patience to get the shots we needed. They had always been stressful and unpleasant experiences.

In comes my brother in law who was getting married and he asked Crystal and me to shoot his wedding. We agreed with the stipulation that we couldn't guarantee anything and they graciously accepted. The panic then set in. Yeah, we know how to setup a composition and understand exposure, but posing and lighting not so much. I started experimenting with my lighting and quickly learned we needed to work with light to get really exciting images. We invested in some wireless triggers and umbrellas to shoot our Speedlights through and practiced the whole month leading into the wedding.

Crystal planned out everything to a T. We made a list of all the poses we wanted and organized them into a schedule to coincide with the wedding plans. One of the biggest challenges we had to face was the ceremony itself. It was at night and candle lit. There was some auxiliary stage lights, but it was dark. We needed some pro glass, so we rented a pair of 24-70 f/2.8 lenses. This decision ultimately made all of this possible.

It was a long and exhausting day, but the amazing thing was how much Crystal and I enjoyed it. My good friend Aaron Patterson who is a seasoned wedding photographer warned me that my first wedding would be the worst and that it would get better. He was trying to encourage me and to expect mistakes. We made a few but overall, we rocked it. Everything went so smooth and we had so much fun doing it.

In the end it came down to a month's worth of preparation and practice, having the right gear and most of all an open mind with a good attitude. Shooting with my wife was kind of scary in and of itself because we have slightly different tastes and opinions on how things need to get done. Yet somehow we gelled and it all came together in the end.

So guess what? I want do it again.

I'm not going to give up on my landscapes and licensing that kind of work. I'm just going to seek out wedding and portrait clients now that I know that I don't actually hate shooting people. I've been approached in the past and I turned that work down. In my initial <a title="Going Pro: Starts Today" href="http://ericleslie.com/blog/going-pro-starts-today/">Going Pro post</a>, I suggested I'd teach work shops. That's looking less likely now and more likely weddings and portraiture.

Weddings are a very crowded market and I'm going to work very hard to differentiate myself from the rest. Using light is going to be central for my work. In my area, it isn't very common. I also want to mix in some of my landscape experience bring it in together giving clients some truly unique work. The challenging will be to carefully craft my new branding. I don't want to throw away everything I've already worked for yet I am going to selling something that you don't see mixed together often.

I am completely biased but I think the photos came out fantastically!

How many of you guys love shooting landscapes and think the idea of shooting a wedding is too scary? Perhaps you'll rethink it.
