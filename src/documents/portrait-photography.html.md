###Capture your life's moments in a comfortable and fun atmosphere.
I know what an honor and a privilege it is to be entrusted with your memories, so I treat every shoot like gold. I also know how awkward it can be to have a stranger (me) take pictures of you, so I always keep the mood relaxed and fun. My clients always loosen right up and we have a great time.

		<h4>I am a GOOD match for:</h4>
		<p>You should hire me if the photography is of the utmost importance to you and you want more than simple documentation. I shoot couples who want works of art and are willing to do their part to make it happen. We plan out great photo-taking opportunities.</p>
		<p>I love finding great locations to shoot at times of the day when the light is fantastic. Team that with lighting equipment and the latest techniques, I will deliver a package filled with crafted works of art.</p>

	<div class="span6">
		<h4>I am a BAD match for:</h4>
		<p>I am not a discount, by-the-hour kind of photographer. I'm not a good match for those that just "need a photographer" and only want basic photos of the day.</p>

##The Portrait Package
Every shoot shares the same base features. A lot of time, a lot of great pictures and a lot of fun! Below you'll find all the specifics for the different kinds of shoots.

 * **Tons of Images**  
 Just like time limits, you're not paying for a package of say 5 images. You get everything I shoot and each photo is hand processed. It depends on how long we shoot, but trust me, you get a lot of shots.
 * **Order Prints A La Carte**  
 You can order prints in any combination of size, medium and quantity right off the online gallery from a professional lab. This is really convenient for family members who would like prints of their own. All prints are made at a Pro Lab, where print quality is excellent and they will last a lifetime using museum-rated archival papers and inks. There is not comparison with prints made at your local retail store.
 * **Free Online Gallery**  
 All of your images are available in an online gallery, forever. There are no time limits so you can rest assured that your images are backed-up in state of the art cloud storage. Prints will always be available as well.
 * **Personal Usage Rights**  
 You are free to use the images how ever you like, so long as it's personal (non-commercial). So you can share them on Facebook or post them to your blog.
 * **Free Print Rights**  
 You are free to print any of the images yourself. If you want the absolute best quality and printing options, order premium prints from the online gallery.

###When are you available?
Be sure to say hello and find out if I'm available. The best light is in the evenings so make plans that work at that time of the day. If we need to hike out to a location, plan enough time to get there when the light is good. If the weather is cold, be sure to bring warm clothes.

My calendar is always changing, so please contact me so we can get you booked.
