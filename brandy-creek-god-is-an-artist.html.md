Last year when I started exploring Whiskeytown Unit, I headed up to Brandy Creek with hopes of exploring Brandy Creek Falls. Having plans is good, but if other opportunities arise, I'm all over them. Such was the case this day.

At the parking area for the hike, I walked down to the creek and saw beautiful landscapes everywhere I looked. In fact I started heading down stream away from the falls. About a 1/4 mile downstream I found this little slice of paradise. 

It's really a very simple scene, but it really strikes me with beauty. The green tropical-like vegetation, the pretty cascades dancing over polished granite into emerald pools of water.
